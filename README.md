## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

* As a user I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and be able to easily navigate throughout the site. 
* As a user I want to find information about their education, skills and experience.
* As a user I want to find their previous projects easily.
* As a user I want to find the best way to contact them to send a new project request and/or get a new project budget.
* As a user I want to be able to find their contact details and social media links easily to get in touch.
* As a user I want to be able to download their CV easily without many clicks.
* As a user I want to be able to access this website on my mobile device or table.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

-   The five main colours used are:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101809642/221332952-b8ecfa5c-ad41-4791-8199-59d461c8310c.png)

-   The palette has been chosen for the color blue usually calling to mind a feeling of peace, order and security. Also for being seen as a sign of reliability, professionalism and stability, often bringing trust from users to content. 
        
#### Typography

-   The Georgia font is the main font used throughout the whole website with 'Times New Roman' and then Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Georgia is a serif font used frequently in resumes, so it is both easilly readable and appropriate.

#### Imagery

-  Imagery is important. The large background image is designed to be relaxing and make the user feel confortable. It also has a professional, serene aesthetic still keeping within the palette.

### Wireframes

-  Desktop Wireframe  -

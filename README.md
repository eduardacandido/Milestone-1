Project - User-Centric Frontend Development - Eduarda Candido's Portfolio.

[View the live project here.](https://eduardacandido.github.io/milestone-01/)

This is the main marketing website for Eduarda Candido's work. As a beginner web developer she desired having an easy way to show her work for new contractors.

The site will be targeted toward business owners, or anyone else looking for a web developer to build a website for any purpose. 

It is designed to be responsibe and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential recruiters and clients.

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

* As a user I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and be able to easily navigate throughout the site. 
* As a user I want to find information about their education, skills and experience.
* As a user I want to find their previous projects easily.
* As a user I want to find the best way to contact them to send a new project request and/or get a new project budget.
* As a user I want to be able to find their contact details and social media links easily to get in touch.
* As a user I want to be able to download their CV easily without many clicks.
* As a user I want to be able to access this website on my mobile device or table.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

-   The five main colours used are:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101809642/221332952-b8ecfa5c-ad41-4791-8199-59d461c8310c.png)

-   The palette has been chosen for the color blue usually calling to mind a feeling of peace, order and security. Also for being seen as a sign of reliability, professionalism and stability, often bringing trust from users to content. 
        
#### Typography

-   The Georgia font is the main font used throughout the whole website with 'Times New Roman' and then Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Georgia is a serif font used frequently in resumes, so it is both easilly readable and appropriate.

#### Imagery

-  Imagery is important. The large background image is designed to be relaxing and make the user feel confortable. It also has a professional, serene aesthetic still keeping within the palette.

### Wireframes

-  Desktop Wireframe  -

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   As a user I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
    -   Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page section of their choice. Underneath there is a Serene Image with Text to call the atention and show the purpose of the website.

-   As a user I want to find information about them as well as their education, skills and experience.
    -   As soon as the user starts srcolling there are the developer's picture and personal details.
    -   The user can continue scrolling down to find more information about the developer's skill, education and experience or click on about button in the navigation bar.

-   As a user I want to find their previous projects easily.
    -   The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of the page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page section they will end up at clearly, including projects section.
    -   At the bottom of the page there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.

-   As a user I want to find the best way to contact them to send a new project request and/or get a new project budget.
    -   There is a navigation bar fixed to the top of the page with a Contact link which sends the user from any part of the site directly to our Contact page section, where they will find a form to send project requests.
    -   They can also email projects requests using the email provided in the About page section.
    -   The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill their email address in the "To" section.

    -   The user can scroll to the bottom of the page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
    -   Contact details as phone number and email address can be found with the personal details in the home page section.

    -   The navigation bar clearly highlights the 'Download CV' Page.
    -   Alternatively, there is also a 'Download' button fixed to the bottom-left of the page, which like the link in the navigation bar, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.

    -   The website is completely responsive and can be accessed from any device.

### Further Testing

-  The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-  The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Motorola G10, Samsung S20FE and large TV screen.
-  A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages sections were linking correctly.
-  Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Fixed Bugs

The original plan of this site was to have a multi page site, homepage, about, projects, contact. During the development and testing of the site it was found to be distracting for the user to be navigating to a page with small sections. The overall plan of a multi plan website was adjusted to make a single page application that would hold all of the necessary content and easy to access information on the one page. Although the site was originally planned to be multi page, the overall project kept the same concepts and layout just placed on one page.

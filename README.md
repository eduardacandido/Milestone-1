[View the live project here.](https://eduardacandido.github.io/milestone-1/)

This is the main marketing website for Eduarda Candido's work. As a beginner web developer she desired having an easy way to show her work for new contractors.

The site will be targeted toward business owners, or anyone else looking for a web developer to build a website for any purpose. 

It is designed to be responsibe and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential recruiters and clients.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    * As a user I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and be able to easily navigate throughout the site. 
    * As a user I want to find information about their education, skills and experience.
    * As a user I want to find their previous projects easily.
    * As a user I want to find the best way to contact them to send a new project request and/or get a new project budget.
    * As a user I want to be able to find their contact details and social media links easily to get in touch.
    * As a user I want to be able to download their CV easily without many clicks.
    * As a user I want to be able to access this website on my mobile device or table.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The five main colours used are:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101809642/221332952-b8ecfa5c-ad41-4791-8199-59d461c8310c.png)
        -   The palette has been chosen for the color blue usually calling to mind a feeling of peace, order and security. Also for being seen as a sign of reliability, professionalism and stability, often bringing trust from users to content. 
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Georgia font is the main font used throughout the whole website with 'Times New Roman' and then Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Georgia is a serif font used frequently in resumes, so it is both easilly readable and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large background image is designed to be relaxing and make the user feel confortable. It also has a professional, serene aesthetic still keeping within the palette.

        * The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill their email address in the "To" section.

    6. As a user I want to be able to download their CV easily without many clicks.
        * The navigation bar clearly highlights the 'Download CV' Page.
        * Alternatively, there is also a 'Download' button fixed to the bottom-left of the page, which like the link in the navigation bar, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
